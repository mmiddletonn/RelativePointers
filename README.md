# Window Direction Indicator

## Overview

This project displays a dynamic arrow in a web page that points towards the direction of other open windows (or tabs) of the same website.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to calculate the position of the current window relative to other open windows. It then adjusts the direction of a centrally located arrow to point towards these windows. The positions are stored and updated in the browser's local storage, allowing for communication between windows.
